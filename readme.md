# beamer-md-slides

Dead simple markdown to pdf slides using pandoc.

Use this as a starting point when you get tired of Powerpoint but also don't want to use Latex.

I'll eventually add a nicer template.

A slightly more robust template without a lot of LaTeX cruft is here: http://www.latextemplates.com/template/beamer-presentation. This just requires the `pdflatex` command to render.
